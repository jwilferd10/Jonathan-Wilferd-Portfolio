When the portfolio loads the viewer see's my name, three recent photos, and can use the links above to navigate through the page.<br>
CSS Grid has been used to create the "Work" section and when the image is clicked, will take the viewer to the correct page<br>
The portfolio has been edited to fit a smaller screen size to the best of my current capabilities.<br>

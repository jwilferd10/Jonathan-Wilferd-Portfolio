## :wave: Description

### 😁 Welcome to my FIRST portfolio page! 
This repository and its associated website serves as a snapshot of the early stages of my journey as a web developer. When I initially created this website, I was immersed in UCLA's Coding Bootcamp, ardently absorbing programming concepts and honing my skills. One of my assignments was to create a web portfolio. The result of that resides within this digital page.

### 💹 Explore My Journey
While navigating through this portfolio, you'll find a website that showcases what I created as a new Web Developer. Instead of refactoring and updating this repository I'd rather highlight this period in my development as a milestone. 

### 🙏 Thank You
Above all, thank you for visiting and exploring my first portfolio. It is my hope that this repository can provide insight for aspiring developers, offering a glimpse of what to anticipate when starting out. With dedication and perseverance, your skill set can expand and evolve over time. Thanks again and happy coding!
